# UR3e Environment Repository

This repository consists of guidelines to setup ROS2 and Webots with a UR3e simulation environment. 

## System requirements

It is highly recommended to run Webots on a supported [GPU](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements), however, it can also work without a graphics card.
For this, make sure you have, or update to the latest GPU drives from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx), and that your system has at least **OpenGL 3.3**.

The following operating systems are supported:
* Linux (preferred)
* Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To install WSL, follow these [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). A current limitation is that [nvidia-docker2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#known-limitations-for-linux-cuda-apps) for WSL is still under development and for that reason ROS2 and Webots can only be installed through docker without GPU support. For a GPU system a bash script will be provided instead of docker. 
* Mac (currently doesn't work properly)

<!-- ## Dependencies
* For WSL, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 

## [Optionally] Configure WSL2 through Visual Studio Code
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Open VSC and download the "Remote - WSL" and "Remote - Containers" extensions from the Extensions tab on the left hand side.
3. From the green icon on the left-down corner, choose "New WSL Window"
4. You can now interact with the Ubuntu documents and terminal -->

## Installation guidelines

This repository contains three options. 
* **I. ROS2 Foxy - Webots on Ubuntu (with or without GPU)**
* **II. ROS2 Foxy - Webots on WSL (with or without GPU)**
* **III. ROS2 Foxy - Webots on Mac**

Follow the one suitable for your System:

## II. ROS2 + Webots on NVidia docker -->

### Prerequisites

These tools will be installed in step 3. Ignore it if they are already installed 

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (and make sure is running)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [docker-nvidia2](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)

### Installation

1. Open a terminal, navigate in the 'home' directory, and create a folder in which you will save the dockerfiles, eg "ur3e_utilities".
```
mkdir -p ur3e_utilities
chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/ur3e_utilities
cd ur3e_utilities
```
2. Git clone [this repository](https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils) in the root of your workspace folder (ur3e_utilities):
```
git clone https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils.git
```
3. Install the dependencies
* If there is GPU on the system:
  ```
  chmod +x ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_ubuntu_gpu.sh;
  sudo bash ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_ubuntu_gpu.sh
  ```
* Otherwise:
  ```
  sudo bash ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_ubuntu_nogpu.sh
  ```
4. Build the docker:
  ```
  docker-compose -f 084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/compose-ubuntu.yaml build
  ```
5. Run the docker (May need "sudo"):
* If there is GPU on the system:
  ```
  docker run --gpus=all -it -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw ros2_webots
  ```
* Otherwise:
  ```
  rocker --devices /dev/dri/card --x11 ros2_webots
  ```
6. By now, you already set up and can interact with ROS2 and Webots in docker. Inside the docker, install the rest repositories. Remember to source everytime you open a new terminal:
```
cd cocobots_ws/src/;
git clone git@github.com:opallch/ur3e_environment.git;
cd ..;
colcon build;
source install/local_setup.bash;
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/${USER}/cocobots_ws/install/ur3e_environment/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```
7. To launch the ur3e webots world:
```
ros2 launch ur3e_environment ur3e_launch.py
```



## II. ROS2 Foxy - Webots on WSL (with or without GPU)

A ROS2 Foxy setup with all the required dependencies for this project (and it will be updated on the go), coupled with Webots simulator R2022a in a WSL environment. 
The setup may work with or without GPU (follow the corresponding guidelines).

## II. ROS2 + Webots on NVidia docker -->

### Prerequisites

<!-- * [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (and make sure is running)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* For WSL: [docker-nvidia2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html) -->
The nvidia-docker2 for WSL currently does not support OpenGL applications like Webots, thus, it cannot be installed through a docker. For that reason, that bash script of step 3 will be used instead, or ignore that step if already these tools are installed:

* [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
* [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-debian-package-with-the-advanced-packaging-tool-apt)
* Xserver running, eg [VcXsrvs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). To configure it, follow this [tutorial](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/running-wsl-gui-apps-on-windows-10/ba-p/1493242). 


### Installation

1. Open a terminal, navigate in the 'home' directory, and create a folder "cocobots_ws". This will be your workspace directory

```
mkdir -p cocobots_ws/src
chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/cocobots_ws
cd cocobots_ws 
```
2. Git clone [this repository](https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils) in the root of your workspace folder (cocobots_ws):
```
git clone https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils.git
```
3. Install the dependencies
```
chmod +x ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_wsl.sh;
sudo bash ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_wsl.sh
```
4. Create the workspace
```
colcon build
```
5. Source the workspace (and do it every time you open a new terminal):
```
source install/setup.bash
```
6. By now, you already set up and can interact with ROS2 and Webots in docker. Inside the docker, install the rest repositories. Remember to source everytime you open a new terminal.
```
cd src/;
git clone git@github.com:opallch/ur3e_environment.git;
cd ..;
colcon build;
source install/local_setup.bash;
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/${USER}/cocobots_ws/install/ur3e_environment/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```
7. Configure the Xserver following this [tutorial](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/running-wsl-gui-apps-on-windows-10/ba-p/1493242) (First option: VcXsrv Windows X Server). To avoid having to export the DISPLAY every time that WSL is launched, you can include the command at the end of the /etc/bash.bashrc file:
```
echo "export DISPLAY="`grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0" >> /home/$USER/.bashrc
```
If webots still don't open even after the installation, then run 
```
echo "export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0" >> /home/$USER/.bashrc
```
8. To launch the ur3e webots world:
```
ros2 launch ur3e_environment ur3e_launch.py
```

## III. ROS2 + Webots without NVidia docker -->

### Prerequisites

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (and make sure is running)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker)
* Xserver, eg [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). To install and configure it, follow this [tutorial](https://affolter.net/running-a-docker-container-with-gui-on-mac-os/)

### Installation

1. Open a terminal, navigate in the 'home' directory, and create a folder "ur3e_utilities". This will be your workspace directory

```
mkdir -p ur3e_utilities
chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/ur3e_utilities
cd ur3e_utilities
```
2. Git clone [this repository](https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils) in the root of your workspace folder (ur3e_utilities):
```
git clone https://github.com/ccbts/084_ccbts_utils.git
```
3. Install the dependencies
```
chmod +x ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_mac.sh;
/bin/bash ./084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/setup_project_mac.sh
```
4. Build the docker:
  ```
  docker-compose -f 084_ccbts_utils/webots_ros2/compose-mac.yaml build
  ```
5. Run the docker (May need "sudo"):
  ```
  rocker --devices /dev/dri/card --x11 ros2_webots
  ```
6. By now, you already set up and can interact with ROS2 and Webots in docker. Inside the docker, install the rest repositories. Remember to source everytime you open a new terminal.
```
cd cocobots_ws/src/;
git clone git@github.com:opallch/ur3e_environment.git;
cd ..;
colcon build;
source install/local_setup.bash;
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/${USER}/cocobots_ws/install/ur3e_environment/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```
7. To launch the ur3e webots world:
```
ros2 launch ur3e_environment ur3e_launch.py
```

<!-- </details> -->


## Troubleshooting
1. Error: package not found
  * Make sure to run 'source install/setup.bash'
2. Webots is not opening
  * Make sure DISPLAY had been set correctly by "echo $DISPLAY"
3. Could not load the Qt platform plugin “xcb” … even though it was found
  * Xserver error. Make sure you ran all the steps of the tutorial ([Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/running-wsl-gui-apps-on-windows-10/ba-p/1493242), [Mac](https://affolter.net/running-a-docker-container-with-gui-on-mac-os/))for setting the Xserver, and that the DISPLAY variable has been set correctly
  * If running on MAC, try this before going through the tutorial
  ```
  socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\"$DISPLAY\"
  ```
  * If running on WSL, try exporting this display:
  ```
  export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
  ```
  or this:
  ```
  export DISPLAY=$(route.exe print | grep 0.0.0.0 | head -1 | awk '{print $4}'):0.0
  ```




<!-- 
TODO
1. Write what it is to be done in Windows, what in WSL
2. Clarify what is for Windows (WSL), what for ubuntu 
3. For presentation, add the structure, workspace, package, favourite commands
Nodes: A node is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.
Messages: ROS data type used when subscribing or publishing to a topic.
Topics: Nodes can publish messages to a topic, as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.
Packages: A way to organize software in ROS. A package can contain nodes, message definitions, libraries, datasets etc.

4. Check it out https://www.logic2020.com/insight/tactical/wsl-docker-gpu-enabled-nvidia
Try Run the nvidia/cudagl and then install webots inside locally
Or use the previous docker and change the paths?
